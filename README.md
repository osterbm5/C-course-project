# C-course-project
Repository for C course project

Project should be compiled to the projekti1 file
Compiled using gcc -Wvla -Wall -g -std=c99 project_final.c -o projekti1

projekti_final.c is the source file and projekti.h is the header file

Just a small program to show

!NOTE! The editor complained about my #include lines, this did not occur during the course and seems to be some vscode error, but the program should work fine anyways. The errors started appearing when I set up my github so it is probably related tp that.
